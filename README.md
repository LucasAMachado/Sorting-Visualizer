# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

This web application provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, emphasizing both efficiency and inefficiency. 
The goal is to highlight the functionality of each algorithm rather than focusing solely on execution speed.

## Features

- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, and Selection Sort.
- **Array Generation:** Generate random arrays with adjustable sizes using a slider.
- **Sorting Visualization:** Watch the sorting process in real-time for better understanding.
- **Execution Timer:** Track the time taken by the chosen algorithm to sort the array. (Not exact)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser installed. (Chrome) 

## Important Note on Execution Speed

Please note that the visual representation of sorting algorithms in this web application may not precisely reflect their actual execution speed. 
The animations are built with the use of JavaScript promises and timeouts.

Due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and the deliberate use of delays through promises and timeouts. I did this approach becuase it ensures clarity and comprehension, it may not accurately represent the real-time performance characteristics of the algorithms.
